# README

## Environment
python3.6+

## Files

### Baseline
`human1, human2, human3, mouse1, mouse2, mouse3`

Results are in the train_model, the other file folders are generated by the command line below.

### rawdata
rawdata: 3 batches of human and mouse gene list known, we used human1 to process further modification.

### Modified
fine-tune

simplified

svm.py

### database
Two dictionaries for gene name and ID transform.

For human & mouse database, please download the cloud file. 


## Commands
`Please keep the structure of the files`

### Raw gene list to proper gene pairs 
Add the list needed to be transformed, according to its species.
```python
python3 human_data_process.py human1.csv
python3 mouse_data_process.py human1.csv
```
This command generate a file folder containing the gene pairs.

### Gene pairs to NEPDF data
Add the index, corresponding pair file and a number indicating whether it has labels.
```python
python3 NEPDF_human.py index_train.csv train.csv 1
python3 NEPDF_mouse.py index_train.csv train.csv 1
```
If you don't have labels, the last argument is 0.

To get train/test/whole gene pairs, use corresponding argument.

### To use mouse dataã€€& human data
Download its database to `database` folder.
```bash
https://s3.amazonaws.com/mousescexpression/rank_total_gene_rpkm.h5
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bXazr2LeK0KGHu0wWEzyt69OPW_nNz6O/view?usp=sharing
```

### To run svm.py to apply svm to the data
```
python3 svm.py
```
In the `Modified` file folder
### To draw NEPDF
```
python3 draw.py human1
```
